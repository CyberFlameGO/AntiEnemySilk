# AntiEnemySilk
This plugin checks if enemies are nearby while you're in your own territory, and cancels the SilkSpawners break event if so.
This plugin depends on SilkSpawners and SaberFactions (FUUID is probably supported, if not, check my GitHub profile for how to contact me, and I'll fix it for you)
