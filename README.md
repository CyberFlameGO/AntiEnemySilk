# AntiEnemySilk
This plugin checks if enemies are nearby while you're in your own territory, and cancels the block break event if there are.
Currently there’s a hard-coded radius of 32 blocks, though I’ll make it configurable if I see interest in this plugin.
This plugin depends on SaberFactions (FUUID is probably supported, if not, check my GitHub profile for how to contact me/create an issue, and I'll fix it for you) 
There are a few things this plugin doesn't do, like preventing mob-spawners dropping if an enemy is near when you TNT/creeper-egg the spawner, though I'm open to pull requests! Don't be afraid to submit pulls, I welcome them!
